    "abstract": "This dataset contains the Midnight Scanning Club (MSC) data, a dataset focused on the precise characterization of ten individual subjects via collection of large amounts of per-individual data. Each subject underwent twelve separate two-hour scanning sessions. In the first two sessions we collected four T1 images, four T2 images, four MR angiograms, and eight MR venograms. In the last ten sessions we collected five hours of resting-state fMRI data and over five and a half hours of task fMRI data across three different tasks. Participants also underwent extensive neuropsychological testing. These raw data are all provided here.\n\nIn addition to the raw data, we also provide several derivatives processed using both a volumetric (Talaraich-space) and a surface-based (fs_LR_32k space) pipeline. Volumetric derivatives include cross-session-average T1 and T2 images linearly registered to atlas (Talaraich) space; as well as resting-state data from each scanning session that has been fully prep",
